## New Year Plans
Hey there!
I wasn't too active here, 2022 was a challenging year for many reason. 

Anyway, I plan to focus much Github, and I have a few plans. 
For one, I started a new course, and I guess some daily reports here wouldn't hurt about my progress. 
I also plan to have a few refreshers, practice a bit. Ok a lot.

Anyway, I don't want to build sand castles, so for now I focus on the new course. 

To be honest I'm still writing my goals of this year, so more details later.

Cheers
