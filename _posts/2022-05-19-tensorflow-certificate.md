## TensorFlow certificate

I went through again the now finalized version of the Mrdbourke deep learning course. The old bad habit of memorization came back, I even though at the beginning I was quite confident I that I don’t need to do anything by heart with using the documentation. Anyway, I had the code printed out, and when I had time I tried to figure out the code, what does what, main steps and such on paper.

After that I did a fast recap, I actually recorded as I went through some examples. It wasn’t my best. I didn’t focus on the tasks, I was a bit like a child in the candy shop in the first part. In the second part, as my deadline came closer and closer started to rush, I cut corners. I just went through fast the examples, often not even typing out everything.

Anyway, I met several examples that dealt with problems different I’m used to, so what. I went for the Coursera TensorFlow specialization. People said that it prepared you for the exam, they were right. The only problem at this point was that I had one deep learning course and the tensorflow.com tutorials behind me. The examples seemed way too easy to be true. Yeah, I’ve overcomplicated the things, even with the certification’s handbook accurately stated what is in the exam.

Well, there was another challenge. There was an example code too, to test my hardware, of course my laptop barely, but didn’t pass. The rules of the exam were that I can use Google Colab, so it didn’t seem to be such an issue. 

The first challenge was to figure out how to get the models I saved in google Colab to the PyCharm exam environment. It took my some time to find the folder to put the .h5 files. 

Most of the tasks weren’t too complicated, although at some points I wasn’t sure what code I need to get to the Colab, it took my plenty of trial and error. The last task was especially tricky, because it used a unique dataset and I had to find where it was stored. At last, I finished it just in time. Okay, I had time to double-check everything, still, I was slow. One last thing, if you’re sure that your solution is correct try to re-upload the same solution multiple times. You know, you’re dealing with random numbers under the hood.

In the end of the day that was a certificate done, on the other hand I was here again without simple, straightforward goals.
