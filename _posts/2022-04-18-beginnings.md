Machine learning, deep learning, was a dot on my radar for years. I heard about it in the news, in a university lecture a guest instructor mentioned a diagnostic system that improves itself. 

I researched about modelling while I worked on my thesis, and it came up again. On another university’s site there was some conversion about a website called Kaggle . I also found a deep learning book. The book was very nice, but I had no tools to implement the theory. Kaggle had some mini courses, so I explored the site a bit. And I got stuck. I couldn’t work with the documentation, I didn’t understand the notebooks.

The next steps were around, I finished my B.Sc. I still watched videos about lectures, some conference about machine learning. It was that time that the YouTube algorithm recommended me a video. “2020 Machine Learning Roadmap (still valid for 2021)”. It was almost three hours long, it was a walk-through of a well-organized roadmap of machine learning. I was hooked. I had an overview, a plan to go through, something to branch out from.

It was still a large amount of materials, I checked out his GitHub. It had all the course materials for his courses. I started alone first, but later I picked his paid course. 

There were a few reasons. I wanted to gain momentum, and he already inspired me to try out myself. I’ve learned quite a bit from his GitHub already at that point. I was still curious about what extra the paid version had, maybe I also wanted to support the instructor. Community, networking with other students, was another reason. A nice bonus was that with the monthly sub, I had access to all the courses there.
