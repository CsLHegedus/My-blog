Hello World!

This is my first post using GithubPages and Jekyll, it took two days to figure out everything, but it was worth it! 
(And I forgot about it, I did something at github that messed it up. So I rebuilt the whole thing again… Anyway.)

In the upcoming weekends I’ll upload some posts about how I started, the two courses I finished, the tools I used, and my personal opinion about them. 
I’ll continue with a few words about my first team project, a nice project I’m working on right now, future goals, how I plan to conquer the world and others.
