So I saw a good idea on youtube, a challenge to learn machine learning for 66 consecutive days, just for 5 minutes.  

Before I get into that. I mentioned a course before. 
Well, the course had some advices about what kind of 
people are good as data analyst, statistian and machine 
learning engineer. I still think that the third option 
fits me the best. But now I'm without courses. I could 
go for the overlapping parts, but I focus on making my 
own "course".  

Anyway, first day, I'll write hopefully everyday for a while from now on.  

## Day 1 - Humble beginnings, or re-re-re-re-opening 
I picked up again Andriy Burkov'S "Machine Learning Engineering" book. 
I had some experience with deeplearning and his book is kind of a 
toolbox.  It has a simple, still very useful framework, it's full of 
good practice advices and it covers the full life cycle of a model to
give some perspective. 
It also has a nice glossary, to refresh vocab of data science.  

So to quote some ideas from the book , the part of creating a product: 
in short decision making, product management 
data engineering 
prototype phase ml engineering 
statistics 
production phase ml engineering
reliability engineering  

Other than that I was brainstorming about the content of my course. I'll use mrdbourke's course as basis and extend it here and there 
This is just a draft, sort of  
Stage 1
dnn models - simple linear regression, parts of the model in python, tensorflow, pytorch, first iteration of the workflow,  
different activation functions, non-linearity, first helper fuctions? python, tensorflow, pytorch, use of documentation 
cnn models, parts, first famous architectures (alexnet, vgg16) lstm, gru, etc. use cases some paper here?   
transfer learning - feature extraction, transfer learning

some full fledged papers? when use sequential api and functional api?

Stage 2 deploy a model, barebone website
Stage 3 polished, presentable website?
Stage 4 SQL/ data lake + previous ones
Stage 5 real life data -> database/datalake -> model -> one retraining
